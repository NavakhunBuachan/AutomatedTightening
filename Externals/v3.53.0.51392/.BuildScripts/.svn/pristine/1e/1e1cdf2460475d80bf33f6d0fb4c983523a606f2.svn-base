<!-- 
This file can be imported into any project to add a NuGet reference to SSH,
with the version based on the .NET Framework.

By using a shared file, all projects are guaranteed to reference the same version, 
and if we want to upgrade, only one file needs to be updated.

Example usage:

  <ImportGroup>
	<Import Project=".BuildScripts\NuGet\Grpc.xml" />
  </ImportGroup>
-->
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
	<Choose>
		<When Condition=" '$(FrameworkConfiguration)' == 'net40' ">
			<!-- don't import anything and this doesn't work with .net4 -->

		</When>
		<Otherwise>
			<ItemGroup>
				<PackageReference Include="Grpc">
					<Version>1.18.0</Version>
				</PackageReference>
			</ItemGroup>
		</Otherwise>
	</Choose>	
</Project>
