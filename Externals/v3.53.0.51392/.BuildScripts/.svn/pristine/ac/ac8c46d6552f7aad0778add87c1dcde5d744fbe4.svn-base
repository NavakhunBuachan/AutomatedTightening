This file can be imported into any project to add a NuGet reference to NLog.Targets.ElasticSearch.

By using a shared file, all projects are guaranteed to reference the same version, 
and if we want to upgrade, only one file needs to be updated.

Example usage:
  <ImportGroup>
	<Import Project=".BuildScripts\NuGet\NLog.Targets.ElasticSearch" />
  </ImportGroup>

<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <!-- For latest stable version (no restrictions), can change to Version="[*,9999.0]" -->
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="NLog.Targets.ElasticSearch">
      <Version>7.7.0</Version>
