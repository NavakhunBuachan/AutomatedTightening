<!-- 
This file can be imported into any project to add a NuGet reference to ReportGenerator,
with the version based on the .NET Framework.

By using a shared file, all projects are guaranteed to reference the same version, 
and if we want to upgrade, only one file needs to be updated.

Example usage:

  <ImportGroup>
	<Import Project=".BuildScripts\NuGet\ReportGenerator.xml" />
  </ImportGroup>
-->
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <!-- For latest stable version (no restrictions), can change to Version="[*,9999.0]" -->
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="ReportGenerator">
      <Version>4.8.9</Version>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
