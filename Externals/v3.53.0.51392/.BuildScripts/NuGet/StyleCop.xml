<!-- 
This file can be imported into any project to add a NuGet reference to StyleCop,
with the version based on the .NET Framework.

By using a shared file, all projects are guaranteed to reference the same version, 
and if we want to upgrade, only one file needs to be updated.

Example usage:

  <ImportGroup>
	<Import Project=".BuildScripts\NuGet\StyleCop.xml" />
  </ImportGroup>
-->
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <!-- For latest stable version (no restrictions), can change to Version="[*,9999.0]" -->
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="StyleCop.Analyzers" Version="1.1.118">
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
